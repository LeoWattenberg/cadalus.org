# SWOT analysis

## Strengths

- **User-owned cooperative model** — gives users governance and influence over development, which can build loyalty and alignment with user needs.   
- **Open-source software** — enables transparency, community contributions, and the ability for users to modify or fork the code.   
- **EU-based with privacy focus** — positions the project to appeal to organisations concerned about data protection and local economic support.   
- **Clear, phased roadmap** — from smart sketching and floorplans to 3D conversion, Blender integration, and a full BIM.   
- **Emphasis on UX and interoperability** — high-quality output and seamless workflow integration, attractive to professional users.   
- **Blender integration for high-quality visualisation** — leverages an established, powerful open tool for rendering/visualisation. 

## Weaknesses

- **Very early-stage / pre-product risk** — limited current product maturity and resources, no products yet.   
- **Dependence on community/partner funding and contributions** — cooperative and open-source funding models can be slower to secure stable financing and development capacity. It's unlikely I can find any single partner to just send over a few millions to get started.


## Opportunities
- **Market for privacy-forward, EU-based alternatives** — can attract public-sector clients and firms prioritising data sovereignty and GDPR alignment.   
- **Demand for interoperable, user-friendly CAD/BIM tools** — opportunity to win users dissatisfied with complex, proprietary incumbents by offering better UX and workflow integration, especially in the light of [the nordic letter](https://the-nordic-letter.com/) and other public petitions.
- **Leverage open-source and Blender ecosystems** — community contributions, third‑party extensions, and integrations can accelerate development and adoption.   
- **Partnerships and co-founding collaborators** — current call for initial partners creates an opening to form strong strategic alliances with firms, universities, or studios. 

## Threats

- **Strong incumbents and network effects in CAD/BIM** — established vendors and file-format ecosystems make market entry and switching difficult.  
- **Compatibility and standards barriers** — ensuring smooth interoperability with existing industry formats and workflows is technically and commercially challenging.  
- **Funding and sustainability risk** — as an early cooperative project relying on partners and community support, there is a threat of slow funding or resource gaps that delay roadmap delivery.   
- **Potential fragmentation from forks** — while forking is a strength, it can also split contributor effort and confuse customers if governance and direction aren’t clear.
