        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Cadalus is a project to free the <dfn id="AEC"
            >architecture, engineering and construction</dfn
          > (<abbr title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          >) industry from the constraints of proprietary software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past 40 years, the <abbr
            title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          > industry has been dominated by a few proprietary software vendors, which
          has led to a lack of innovation and user experience stagnation. The main
          developments in the industry has been new and exciting monetization strategies,
          from overpriced updates to overpriced subscriptions, to finally overpriced
          and hard-to-calculate token-based pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cadalus is to provide a European, free and independent alternative to
          proprietary CAD, BIM and Archiviz software which nevertheless remains
          interoperable with existing workflows.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Replacing an entire tech stack is best done incrementally, step by
          step. Each step individually is designed to provide value to the <abbr
            title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          > community.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 0: Preliminary work</h3>
        <p>
          Before any development can start, a lot of preliminary work needs to
          be done. This includes research into the problem space, interviews
          with architects, engineers and builders, and a lot of planning. It
          also includes incorporation, and sorting of financing. This stage is
          already underway and is yielding documents like a <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19d92lmaWdz65u3FSWV8HIRitgrWZhYYpiL-dAyf0_ds/edit?usp=sharing"
            >finance plan</a
          > for this and the following stages, SWOT analyses, a <a
            href="/articles of association"
            >draft for the articles of association</a
          > and so on. This work is currently being done by Leo Wattenberg, the initiator
          of the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 1: Quick sketches and floorplans</h3>
        <p>
          Being able to quickly generate sketches and floorplans is the core
          feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plans should be easy and fast to create, with the program
          intelligently layouting the document to create a high-quality output
          which can be used by builders without further tweaking. Additionally,
          the output of this program should be interoperable with existing
          software, so that using Cadalus at this stage remains useful in
          production.
        </p>
        <p>This stage would require two people to work on Cadalus.</p>
        <h3>Stage 2: Sketch to 3D geometry</h3>
        <p>
          CAD sketches by definition contain all measurements necessary to
          construct a 3D environment. This process should happen automatically
          (perhaps: in the background), to create a fast check with a
          three-dimensional reality and quickly spot impossibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that this work is now "real CAD" work, a full team is required
          here: Product owner, designer, 3x developers and a QA.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 3: Geometry to visualizations</h3>
        <p>
          Once 3D geometry exists, the European open source program <a
            href="https://blender.org">Blender</a
          > can take over and do PBR materials, lighting, animation and rendering.
          Blender has been doing massive strides recently, and outperforms many commercial
          applications already. Cadalus would provide a method to integrate with
          Blender to create high-quality visualizations of the 3D geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work on Cadalus at this stage would include improving the CAD
          workflows, and providing meaningful base assets for visualizations.
          The aforementioned 6-people team would be sufficient to get this stage
          done, though a given the parallelization of some of this work, a
          larger team of up to 15 people may be appropriate (depending on
          funding).
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 4: A fully-fledged BIM</h3>
        <p>
          Going from a CAD to a BIM certainly is a longer process, but
          ultimately only a problem of data input and features which perform
          calculations based on that data. That is to say, it's all in the realm
          of possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          What features would need to be implemented with what priority would be
          up to the <abbr title="architecture, engineering and construction"
            >AEC</abbr
          > community. The team size here would grow appropriately with the people,
          though likely will remain comparatively lean as building new features tends
          to be easier than maintaining ancient, crusty code found in other CAD software.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 5: Continuous development and maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Once the initial stages are done, the project enters the fairly
          unexciting stage of just maintaining a good tool. This means
          supporting additional use cases, fixing bugs, ensuring compatibility
          with new hardware and software, and ensuring that the software remains
          usable and useful for the <abbr
            title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          > community.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="realization">
        <h2>Realization</h2>
        <p>
          Cadalus requires comparatively few resources to get started. The
          equivalent of 8 seat licenses of the Autodesk <abbr
            title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          > Collection would be enough to hire a full-time employee, so to complete
          stage two with with six employees, an equivalent of 50 seat licenses might
          well be enough. This means if only 1% of the architecture firms in Denmark
          alone would be willing to support this initiative, this project would be
          sustainable.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical realization</h3>
        <p>
          On a technical level, Cadalus will most likely be a Blender extension.
          Doing so has various advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Blender will be part of the chain anyway – at latest in the
            visualization stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's widely known that Blender is a powerful 3D editor, though maybe
            lesser known that it's a powerful 2D drawing and vector graphics
            editor as well, with its grease pencil and curve editor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being a Blender extension means that a lot of the difficult
            technical work – UI system, data model, data management, etc. – is
            already done, and can be used by Cadalus. This massively cuts back
            on development time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Organizational realization</h3>
        <p>
          A European Co-op (SCE) likely would be the best approach here.
          Individuals and architecture firms would join the coop, and both
          finance the operations of the development, and oversee the direction
          of the development. Details may be found in <a
            href="/articles of association">the articles of association</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a full membership might be 500€/month (the price of a
          single Autodesk <abbr
            title="architecture, engineering and construction">AEC</abbr
          > Collection license), with supporting memberships below that level being
          available. Members with a full membership get to vote on what features
          get implemented next, to ensure that the development is in line with their
          very real needs. Supporting members may leave suggestions, but won't have
          the ability to directly influence development.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this model, the co-op would be sustainable extremely quickly. If
          the members feel this price is too high, they might vote to lower the
          membership fee. Likewise, if they feel more development is needed,
          they might vote to increase membership fees, or figure out other means
          to invest into the co-op – or charge non-members for access to the
          software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a normal corporation, this model also avoids a misalignment of
          interests: A VC-funded corporation would enjoy a period of hypergrowth
          where they de-throne the encumbents, but very quickly pivot to being
          comparable to the encumbents, with incredible pricing and draconian
          terms, to make up the 1000x ROI the investors so desperately seek. A
          co-op, funded by members which are also its customers, cannot
          experience this misalignment.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>or rather, miscellanious problems and solutions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to ensure adoption of Cadalus?</strong> The industry is caught
          in a chicken-and-egg problem at the moment: Everyone uses AutoCAD and Revit,
          therefore universities teach AutoCAD and Revit, therefore everyone learns
          AutoCAD and Revit, therefore everyone uses AutoCAD and Revit. To break
          this cycle, Cadalus needs to have explicit support from the industry, so
          universities can confidently start taching Cadalus. By using a co-op model,
          the industry is involved from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Should Cadalus be free?</strong> Ideally, yes. Charging for the
          software creates an unnecessary barrier in an already fairly gatekept industry.
          Given the strong professionalization of the user base, there's a strong
          sales argument to pay for high-priority bugfixes and support (becoming
          a member), to avoid a day of lost work or downtime. If Hans-Peter can now
          lay out his living room slightly better, or Dmitry from Unregulatistan
          now is able to design a building which won't fall over – that's great,
          but also not the sort of audience which would have paid for such a software
          to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Should Cadalus be open source?</strong> As a Blender extension,
          it is required to be. However, even if it wasn't, there is a good reason
          to go open source: To avoid the risk of vendor lock-in, to encourage interoperability,
          and to avoid the risk of mismanagement ruining the software forever – you
          can always fork.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Are there regulations, Norms, Lobbying, which requires proprietary
            solutions?</strong
          > Maybe. But for once, the lobby is on our side: There are very few creators
          of proprietary CADs and BIMs, but <em>a lot</em> of <abbr>AEC</abbr> businesses
          responsible for unimportant things like <em
            >our entire built environment</em
          >. Whatever regulations in place surely can be adapted to allow for
          something like Cadalus to exist.

          <strong
            >Is there a financial reason to become a Cadalus member?</strong
          >
          At its current rate of 460€/month, across a 40 year carreer, the average
          architect can expect to pay 220k € to Autodesk. Given there no doubt will
          be price hikes throughout, this number can be expected to grow well beyond
          a quarter million euros, per architect. Cadalus meanwhile would be more
          like an investment: Once the software is mature, you may choose to drop
          out of the co-op, and keep using the software – for free. In the long run,
          this will save you a lot more money.
